power bi dashboard
Overview:
This Power BI project focuses on creating a dynamic financial dashboard that provides actionable insights into credit card transaction data and customer behavior. It utilizes SQL Server data to analyze key performance indicators, trends, and patterns in consumer spending and credit usage.

Project Objectives:
Derive valuable insights from SQL Server data related to credit card transactions and customer usage.

Perform weekly trend analysis to identify spending patterns and revenue changes over time.

Assist stakeholders in decision-making by delivering an intuitive, visually engaging dashboard.

Key Steps:
Data Extraction: Retrieved raw data on credit card transactions and customer profiles from multiple sources.

Database Setup: Created a local SQL Server database to store and organize both transaction data and customer information for efficient querying.

Data Cleaning & Transformation: Connected the SQL database to Power BI, where raw data was cleaned, transformed, and prepared for analysis using Power Query.

DAX Calculations: Developed custom measures and calculated columns, including:

Creating age groups for demographic segmentation.

Categorizing income levels for financial analysis.

Calculating week-on-week changes to track revenue trends.

Dashboard Creation: Designed a comprehensive, user-friendly dashboard with the following key pages:

Credit Card Transaction Report: Focused on transaction trends and revenue insights.

Credit Card Customer Report: Highlighted customer demographics, behavior, and segment-wise contributions.

Key Insights: Summarized overarching financial trends and metrics for a quick overview.

Insights & Outcomes:

Demographic Analysis: Examined contributions by gender and income levels to understand consumer dynamics.

Activation & Delinquency Rates: Provided a deeper dive into customer engagement metrics, such as activation rates and delinquency trends, to inform risk management strategies.

Customer Segmentation: Enabled more personalized strategies by understanding customer behavior across age groups and income brackets.

Tools & Technologies:
SQL Server: Efficiently managed and queried large datasets.

Power BI: Designed interactive visualizations and conducted in-depth data analysis.

DAX: Used for advanced calculations and measures.

By combining SQL Server’s robust data management capabilities with Power BI’s intuitive visualizations, this project transformed raw data into meaningful insights, empowering stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.
